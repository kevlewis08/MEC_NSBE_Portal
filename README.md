# NSBE App

## Project Overview

The NSBE App is a web application designed to serve as a comprehensive portal for the NSBE Student Chapter at Medgar Ever College. This project is aimed at creating an interactive platform tailored for students in the fields of Engineering and Science. The primary goal of this application is to enhance the experience of NSBE members by providing a central hub for accessing information, networking, and discovering opportunities relevant to their academic and career pursuits.

## Project Goals

The following key objectives drive the NSBE App project:

1. **Centralized Information:** Create a one-stop platform for NSBE members to access up-to-date information about chapter meetings, events, and membership details.

2. **Networking Opportunities:** Facilitate connections between Science and Engineering students, allowing them to establish relationships with peers and mentors.

3. **Opportunity Discovery:** Enable students to explore scholarships, internships, and job opportunities directly related to their fields of study.

4. **Knowledge Sharing:** Offer a resource library that aggregates academic materials, research papers, and online courses.

5. **Engagement and Community Building:** Foster a sense of community by providing forums for discussions, event participation, and knowledge sharing.

6. **User Feedback Integration:** Continuously improve the app by gathering feedback and insights from users.

## Project Context

The NSBE App is developed in the context of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) Student Chapter at Medgar Ever College. It serves as a digital solution to address the specific needs and requirements of NSBE members pursuing careers in Engineering and Science. By centralizing chapter-related information, networking opportunities, and valuable resources, the app aims to enhance the educational and professional journey of its users.

## fulfills the project requirements

The NSBE Events web page successfully fulfills the project requirements outlined for a comprehensive platform catering to the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) student chapter at MEC. The webpage features a clean and intuitive design, ensuring a positive user experience. The navigation menu includes essential sections such as "Home," "Meetings," "Events," "Scholarship," and "Internship," providing students with easy access to pertinent information. The events section incorporates the FullCalendar library, offering an interactive and visually appealing display of upcoming events and meetings. This feature aligns with the objective of keeping students informed about ongoing CUNY events and meetings in the area.

The webpage demonstrates responsive design, adjusting gracefully to various screen sizes, enhancing accessibility for users on different devices. The inclusion of external libraries like FullCalendar, jQuery, and moment.js enhances the functionality and visual appeal of the events section. Additionally, a "Return to Home" button at the bottom of the page allows users to easily navigate back to the NSBE home page, fostering a seamless user experience. Overall, the NSBE Events webpage successfully meets the specified project requirements, providing a centralized platform for NSBE students at MEC to stay informed about crucial events, meetings, and opportunities within the Science and Engineering disciplines.
