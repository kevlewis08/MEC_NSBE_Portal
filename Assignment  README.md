Determine the content, structure, and design of your NSBE web page. Consider what information you want to include, such as the chapter's mission, events, membership details, and any other relevant information.

b.Set Up Your Development Environment. Ensure you have a code editor for writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Popular code editors include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. You'll also need a web browser for testing your web page.

c.Create a New Project Directory. Create a new directory (folder) for your web page project. This is where you'll store your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

d. Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) in your project directory. 

e.Add Content: Within the <body> tags, add the content for your NSBE web page. This may include headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other HTML elements.

b.Inside the <body> section of your HTML file, add the following code to create links for "Chapter Meetings," "Events," and "Membership".

c.Save your HTML file with the links.

d.Create separate HTML files for "Chapter Meetings," "Events," and "Membership" content. You can name them accordingly, e.g., meetings.html, events.html, and membership.html.

e.In each of these HTML files, add content related to the respective sections. For example, in "meetings.html," you can include information about chapter meetings, and in "events.html," include details about upcoming events. Similarly, in "membership.html," provide information about NSBE membership and how to join. If you want to create a consistent navigation menu, you can include the same navigation links in the header or footer of each HTML file for easy access.
